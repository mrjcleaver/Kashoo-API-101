A quick hacky set of shell scripts to test Kashoo's JSON/XML API
- see https://api.kashoo.com/

getAuthToken.sh userid
- creates an APITOKEN file for you, from your user and password

getBusinessNumber.sh
- from your APITOKEN file, prints out your BUSINESS_ID
- YOU need to save this to a file called BUSINESS_ID 

testConnect.sh
- calls the https://www.kashoo.com/api/users/me/businesses end point
- per https://api.kashoo.com/rest.users.me.businesses.html
- see http://support.kashoo.com/customer/portal/questions/115631-api-error

callAPI.sh	      
- calls any endpoint, defaults to transfers
- see the REST list on https://api.kashoo.com


TO DO
- I should have used a decent scripting language and a REST client (not curl)
